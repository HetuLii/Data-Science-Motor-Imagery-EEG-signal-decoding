# Introduction
This repository contains a replication study of several baseline and state-of-the-art models focusing on motor imagery EEG signal decoding. Further, experiments on some unaddressed questions are carried out and recorded. This project aims to:
* Provide pre-processed, augmented, and ready-to-use motor imagery EEG dataset **BCIC-IV-2A**
* Compare the cross-subject performances of models including fundamental **CNN**, **LSTM** models, hybrid models, **EEGNet-8,2** model [4], and **EEGNeX** model [1] in pytorch
* Enable other researchers to conveniently carry out cross-subject comparisons on their datasets and models
* Investigate the cross-subject efficacy of incorporating **Attention layer** in the EEGNet-8,2 model
